CS 744: Design and Engineering of Computing Systems

Autumn 2017

PHASE 1 PROJECT REPORT 

I am think of a project on "Polling System" .

Voters will act as a clients and there will be a Level-1 server that will authenticate whether the client is a valid registered voter or not . The Level-1 server after authentication will fetch the list of candidates from Level-2 server and send it to client . The client will then respond to the list of candidates by casting his vote . Level-1 server records the vote casted by each candidates and computation can be performed in any of Level-1 or Level-2 server for the winner .

The concept of region wise winner can also be incorporated in this by having multiple servers at Level-2.


Will that be OK as the project for CS744.
